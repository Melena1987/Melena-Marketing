      title: '5 Local SEO Tips for Shops in Malaga', 
      excerpt: 'Attract more customers from your area by optimizing your presence in local searches. We show you how to start today.',
      content: `<p>In today's competitive market, standing out locally is more important than ever. If you have a physical store in Malaga, local SEO is not an option; it's a necessity. Here are five practical tips to start attracting more customers who are looking for exactly what you offer, right in your neighborhood.</p><h2>1. Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile</h2><p>Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is your digital storefront in Google searches and on Maps. It's free and is the most powerful tool for local SEO.</p><ul><li><strong>Complete all information:</strong> Ensure your name, address, phone number (NAP), and business hours are correct and consistent everywhere.</li><li><strong>Choose the right categories:</strong> Select the categories that best describe your business.</li><li><strong>Upload high-quality photos:</strong> Showcase your location, products, and team. Photos increase engagement.</li></ul><h2>2. Get Customer Reviews</h2><p>Reviews are a signal of trust for both customers and Google. Encourage your satisfied customers to leave a review. Respond to all reviews, both positive and negative, professionally. This shows that you care about your customers' opinions.</p><h2>3. Optimize Your Website for Local Searches</h2><p>Your website needs to "speak" the local language. Include the name of your city or neighborhood in strategic places:</p><ul><li>In title tags and meta descriptions.</li><li>In headings (H1, H2).</li><li>In the content of your pages, such as the "About Us" or "Contact" page.</li></ul><h2>4. Create Relevant Local Content</h2><p>Blog about local events, news from your neighborhood, or collaborations with other businesses in Malaga. This not only attracts a local audience but also signals to Google that your business is an active part of the community.</p><h2>5. Ensure Consistency of Your Citations (NAP)</h2><p>NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone. It is crucial that this information is identical across all online directories where your business appears (Yellow Pages, Yelp, local directories, etc.). Inconsistency can confuse Google and hurt your ranking.</p><p>By implementing these five tips, you will take a big step toward improving your visibility in local searches and attracting more customers from Malaga to your door.</p>`

      title: 'How to Use Instagram for Your Restaurant and Fill Tables', 
      excerpt: 'Discover visual and content strategies to turn followers into loyal diners for your hospitality business.',
      content: `<h2>The Power of Visuals in Gastronomy</h2><p>Instagram is a predominantly visual platform, and few industries benefit from this as much as the restaurant business. An appetizing photo can be the trigger a potential customer needs to decide to visit your establishment. It's not just about posting pictures of your dishes, but about telling a story and creating an atmosphere that invites people to live the experience.</p><h3>Practical Tips for Your Instagram Strategy:</h3><ul><li><strong>High-Quality Photography:</strong> Invest in good photos. Natural light is your best ally. You don't need expensive professional equipment; many modern smartphones take incredible pictures. Focus on the details, textures, and colors of your dishes.</li><li><strong>Show the "Behind the Scenes":</strong> People love to see the process. Show your chefs in action, the arrival of fresh produce from the market, or the preparation of a new cocktail. This humanizes your brand and builds trust.</li><li><strong>User-Generated Content (UGC):</strong> Encourage your customers to post photos at your restaurant and tag you. Share their best photos in your stories or on your feed (always ask for permission!). It's the best advertising there is.</li><li><strong>Use Stories for Daily Content:</strong> Instagram Stories are perfect for more ephemeral and casual content. Announce the dish of the day, conduct polls on which dessert your followers prefer, or show the ambiance of your place on a Friday night.</li><li><strong>Collaborate with Local Influencers:</strong> Identify foodies or influencers in your city and invite them to try your menu. A positive review from someone with a loyal local community can attract many new customers.</li></ul><p>Remember that the key is consistency. Post regularly, interact with your followers, and maintain a coherent visual style. You'll soon see your community grow and your tables fill up!</p>`

      title: 'The Importance of a Professional Logo for Your SME', 
      excerpt: 'Your brand is more than a name. We analyze why a solid visual identity is a crucial investment for success.',
      content: `<h2>Your Logo: The Face of Your Business</h2><p>For a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME), every detail counts when it comes to building a reputation and attracting customers. Often, the logo is the first point of contact a potential customer has with your brand. An amateurish design can convey a lack of professionalism, while a well-designed logo communicates trust, quality, and seriousness from the first glance.</p><h3>Why is it an Investment, Not an Expense?</h3><ul><li><strong>Creates a Memorable First Impression:</strong> You have only a few seconds to capture attention. A professional logo is memorable and helps customers remember your business over the competition.</li><li><strong>Differentiates You from the Competition:</strong> In a saturated market, a unique logo helps you stand out. It reflects the personality of your business and what makes you special.</li><li><strong>Fosters Brand Loyalty:</strong> As your business grows, your logo becomes a familiar symbol to your customers. People are drawn to what they know and trust. A consistent logo across all your materials (website, business cards, social media) reinforces that trust.</li><li><strong>Communicates Professionalism and Trust:</strong> A well-designed logo suggests that you take your business seriously. This is especially important for new companies that need to build their credibility from scratch.</li></ul><p>Think about the big brands you admire. Their logo is instantly recognizable and evokes emotions and expectations. Although your SME may not be a multinational corporation, the principle is the same. Investing in a professional logo is investing in the future and perception of your brand. It is a fundamental piece in building a successful and lasting business.</p>`

      title: 'Quick Guide: How to Set Up Your Hostinger Business Email',
      excerpt: 'Learn how to set up your Hostinger email on Apple Mail, Gmail, and Outlook with our updated step-by-step guide.',
      content: `<h2>Having an email address with your own domain (like contact@yourcompany.com) projects professionalism and trust.</h2>
<p>If you use Hostinger, setting up your business email in your favorite mail apps like Apple Mail, Gmail, and Outlook is a straightforward process. This step-by-step guide will show you how to do it with the updated configuration settings for 2025.</p>

<h3>Step 0: Locate Your Configuration Settings in Hostinger</h3>
<p>Before you start, you need your mail server details. Don't worry, they are always the same for all Hostinger accounts!</p>
<ol>
  <li>Access your Hostinger hPanel.</li>
  <li>Go to the "Emails" section and select the domain for which you want to configure the email.</li>
  <li>In the side menu, look for "Connect Apps & Devices".</li>
</ol>
<p>There you will find the following parameters, which you will use in the next steps:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Protocol</th>
      <th>Server (Hostname)</th>
      <th>Port</th>
      <th>Encryption</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Incoming Mail</td>
      <td>IMAP (Recommended)</td>
      <td>imap.hostinger.com</td>
      <td>993</td>
      <td>SSL/TLS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Incoming Mail</td>
      <td>POP3 (Alternative)</td>
      <td>pop.hostinger.com</td>
      <td>995</td>
      <td>SSL/TLS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Outgoing Mail</td>
      <td>SMTP</td>
      <td>smtp.hostinger.com</td>
      <td>465</td>
      <td>SSL/TLS</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> It is recommended to use IMAP instead of POP3. IMAP syncs your emails across all your devices, which means if you read or delete an email on your phone, the change will be reflected on your computer and vice versa.</p>

<h3>1. How to Set Up Your Email in Apple Mail (iPhone, iPad, and Mac)</h3>
<p>Apple's interface makes this process very intuitive.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open "Settings" on your iPhone/iPad or "Mail" > "Add Account" on your Mac.</li>
  <li>Select "Mail" > "Accounts" > "Add Account".</li>
  <li>In the list of providers, choose the "Other" option.</li>
  <li>Tap "Add Mail Account".</li>
  <li>Fill in your details:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> The name you want recipients to see.</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> Your full email address (you@yourdomain.com).</li>
      <li><strong>Password:</strong> The password for that email account.</li>
      <li><strong>Description:</strong> A name to identify the account (e.g., "Work").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tap "Next". Mail will try to verify the account automatically. If it fails, it will ask for the server details.</li>
  <li>Make sure IMAP is selected and fill in the fields with the Hostinger data:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Incoming Mail Server:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Host Name: imap.hostinger.com</li>
          <li>User Name: Your full email address.</li>
          <li>Password: Your email password.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Outgoing Mail Server:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Host Name: smtp.hostinger.com</li>
          <li>User Name: Your full email address.</li>
          <li>Password: Your email password.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tap "Next" and then "Save". Done! Your account is now set up in Apple Mail.</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. How to Set Up Your Email in Gmail (Web and Mobile App)</h3>
<p>You can use the Gmail interface to both receive emails from your Hostinger account and send them using your business address.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Gmail in your desktop browser.</li>
  <li>Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner and select "See all settings".</li>
  <li>Go to the "Accounts and Import" tab.</li>
  <li><strong>To receive emails:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Find the "Check mail from other accounts" section and click "Add a mail account".</li>
      <li>Enter your business email address in the pop-up window and click "Next".</li>
      <li>Select "Import emails from my other account (POP3)" and click "Next".</li>
      <li>Fill in the details with Hostinger's POP3 settings (Gmail does not allow importing via IMAP in this section):
        <ul>
          <li>Username: Your full email.</li>
          <li>Password: Your password.</li>
          <li>POP Server: pop.hostinger.com</li>
          <li>Port: 995</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Check the "Always use a secure connection (SSL)" box.</li>
      <li>Optional: Check "Label incoming messages" for better organization.</li>
      <li>Click "Add Account".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>To send emails (very important):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>After adding the account, Gmail will ask if you want to be able to send mail as you@yourdomain.com. Select "Yes" and click "Next".</li>
      <li>Configure the outgoing (SMTP) server with Hostinger's data:
        <ul>
          <li>SMTP Server: smtp.hostinger.com</li>
          <li>Port: 465</li>
          <li>Username: Your full email.</li>
          <li>Password: Your password.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Make sure the "Secured connection using SSL" option is checked.</li>
      <li>Click "Add Account".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gmail will send a verification email to your Hostinger address. Open it (it should already arrive in your Gmail inbox) and click the confirmation link or enter the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now receive and send emails with your business address directly from Gmail!</p>

<h3>3. How to Set Up Your Email in Outlook (Microsoft 365, 2021, etc.)</h3>
<p>Outlook allows for detailed manual configuration to ensure everything works correctly.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Outlook and go to "File" in the top-left corner.</li>
  <li>Click "Add Account".</li>
  <li>Type your business email address.</li>
  <li>Click "Advanced options" and check the "Let me set up my account manually" box.</li>
  <li>Click "Connect".</li>
  <li>On the next screen, choose the account type: IMAP.</li>
  <li>Enter the Hostinger configuration settings:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Incoming mail (IMAP):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Server: imap.hostinger.com</li>
          <li>Port: 993</li>
          <li>Encryption method: SSL/TLS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Outgoing mail (SMTP):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Server: smtp.hostinger.com</li>
          <li>Port: 465</li>
          <li>Encryption method: SSL/TLS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click "Next".</li>
  <li>Enter your password and click "Connect".</li>
</ol>
<p>Outlook will verify the settings, and if everything is correct, your account will be added and ready to use.</p>`
